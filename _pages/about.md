My name is Jue Wang, working as a Machine Learning Scientist in the [Amazon Prime Video Tech](https://www.primevideotech.com/). Before that, I spent wonderful years at Facebook AI Research Lab (FAIR) working with [Prof. Lorenzo Torresani](https://ltorresa.github.io/home.html) and Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL),  working with [Dr. Anoop Cherian](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~cherian/). I received my PhD in the Australian National University under  the supervision of [Dr. Anoop Cherian](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~cherian/), [Prof. Fatih Porikli](http://www.porikli.com) and [Prof. Richard Hartley](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~hartley/). My research interest includes multi-modality deep learning, large-scaled self-supervised training, and various tasks in video understanding. 

Specifically, my current research focus is on:
* Video representation learning for action recognition.
* Vision and Language: video captioning  and video dialog.
* Long-form video understanding.
